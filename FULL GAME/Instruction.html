<h1>Hi-Lo challenge rules</h1>

<p>Hi-Lo, or High-Low, is a fairly simple card game. It uses a deck of 13 cards minus the jokers, and it has players guess whether a certain card is higher or lower than one showing on the table. It is a pretty standard and simple game.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Guess whether the next card will be higher or lower.</p>

<h3>Number of Players</h3>

<p>Technically, the game can have any number of players, but at any given time, there are only two players actually playing. The player plays against the dealer.
The dealer ( dealer is always computer) who is in control of the deck, and the player, who is responsible for guessing the values of cards, are the only participants in this game.
After receiving a card, the player has to say if the following card will be higher or lower in value.
If your prediction is right, the player wins!</p>



<h3>Dealing and Play</h3>

<p>After shuffling the cards in any order and cutting the deck, the computer generates one card face-down in front of the player on the playing table, then another card for player face-up.
The rest cards, he sets aside while the player guesses the value.
After the cards are down, the player places his bet (bet is automatically set for one hundred dollars).
Player starts with budget of one thousand dollars. When the player guesses, he wins or loses the pot depending on the outcome of his guess.
After that round, the player can quit the game or continue to the next round.
And this same principle is used on every round of this game.</p>

<h3>Guessing</h3>

<p>Based on the card that's currently showing, the player has to guess whether the face-down card is higher or lower than the face-up card. After the guess, the dealer flips the hidden card, and the answer is revealed.
If the guess was correct, the player wins and can choose to continue; if not, the player can quit.</p>

<h3>End of the game.</h3>

<p>This game ends If player will reach zero dollars he will be redictered to scoreboard where he can check his game statistics.
Eventually there is a possibility of very good and lucky player, so for him there is a possibility of endlessness playing.
